*External dependencies

- TurboJPEG Library (CPU based compression)
- LibPNG12 (a different version should work)
- NvPipe (H264 GPU based compression https://github.com/NVIDIA/NvPipe)


I. Compilation

$~/Sight_FrameServer/cd Release
$~/Sight_FrameServer/Release/make


Note: all auxiliary files for compilation are available in Release directory. If TurboJPEG Library and/or LibPNG12 are not installing in default locations edit makefile file to add the new paths.

NvPipe and Broadway.js Notes:
-Client uses Broadway.js for H264 decoding, thus only H264 encoding is supported using NvPipe.
-Enable NV_ENC_H264_PROFILE_BASELINE_GUID in NvPipe.
-Broadway.js uses webworkers for decoding. Google Chrome does not support webworker calls from file://, thus Mozilla
Firefox is recommended.


II. Run

1. Run the Server:

 ./Sight_FrameServer 

Sight_FrameServer will listen to port 9002. Make sure this port is open.

2. Run the Client

Open Sight_Client directory and double click on client.html file, then make click on "Stream" button. Sight_FrameServer will generate a 
random color image. 

Controls:

-Press keys '1' and '2' to swtich between rendering modes.
-Sight_FrameServer will output mouse callbacks. 
-Clicking on "Capture" button to save a snapshot, they will be saved in Sight_FrameServer directory.


III. Running Sight_FrameServer remotely in a Cluster

1. Server Configuration

Deploy Sight_FrameServer in the remote system.

Open Sight_FrameServer/header/cBroadCastServer.h file, comment FULLHD macro (code line 20) and uncomment REMOTE macro (code line 19). Follow
compilation instructions. 

2. Client Configuration

In your local system open Sight_FrameServer/Sight_Client/websocketConnection.js, set  jpegCompression variable (code line 18) to true. Save the file.

3. Once configuration is done, you will need two terminals.

In terminal 1:

- Connect to your remote server (and launch and interactive job).
- Check which node  is running  the interactive job (this will be used for  tunneling):
- Run Sight_FrameServer as explained in Section II, make sure 9002 port is open.

In Terminal 2  open a tunneling connection with the node is running the interactive job using port 9002:

$ ssh userid@myserver.com -L 9002:myNodeName:9002

In your local system run the client as explained in Section II.

IV. Running Sight_FrameServer remotely in a server

Follow steps 1 and 2 of Section III.

3. Once configuration is done, you will need two terminals.

In terminal 1:

- Connect to your remote server.
- Run Sight_FrameServer as explained in Section II, make sure 9002 port is open.

In Terminal 2  open a tunneling connection with the server using port 9002:

$ ssh userid@myserver.com -L 9002:myserver.com:9002

In your local system run the client as explained in Section II.
